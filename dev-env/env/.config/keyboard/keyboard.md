# Keyboard config

The file `40-libinput.conf` should be located in `/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf`.

This file is modified for 2 reasons:
1. Enabling natural scrolling in the mouse and mousepad
2. Enable the shortcut to change the keyboard layout from `us` to `es` pressing `win+space`
